# EtherealGambi

Alternative to [DreamStorageService](https://github.com/PerfectDreams/DreamStorageService), but instead of storing files on a database, it is stored on the file system itself.

I made this because most image optimization pipelines (like Cloudflare Images) are SO EXPENSIVE, OMG! I would gladly pay for a good service, but CF Images charges per image served, even if the image was cached!

I didn't want to use DreamStorageService because I wanted a way to host images for Loritta's blog posts in an easier way, just dragging and droppin' the file.

Maybe this project could replace DreamStorageService! Or maybe DreamStorageService will have features that will make this project obsolete... who knows! The fun part is playing around and figuring out what sticks.

So I decided to make my own solution for this, because I just wanted an easy way to store *optimized* images without me caring about expenses and stuff like that.

* Ethereal: extremely delicate and light in a way that seems too perfect for this world.
* Gambi(arra): Workaround because I got fed up with this issue.

## Objectives

* Store files
* Optimize images automatically
* Easy to upload files: Just a folder that you can drag files to it

## Should I use this?

no, it is super hacky.
